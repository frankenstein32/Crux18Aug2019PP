For a binary tree T, we can 
define a flip operation as 
follows: 
choose any node, and swap 
the left and right child 
subtrees.

A binary tree X is flip 
equivalent to a binary tree Y 
if and only if we can make X 
equal to Y after some number 
of flip operations.

Write a function that 
determines whether two 
binary trees are flip 
equivalent.  The trees are 
given by root nodes root1 and 
root2.

	we break the given problem into smaller ones. 





	Let's say we have a problem A and we divided it 
	into three smaller problems B, C and D. Now it 
	may be the case that the solution to A does not 
	depend on all the three subproblems. in fact we 
	don't even know on which one it depends.















	Let's take a situation. Suppose you are standing in 
	front of three tunnels, one of which is having a bag 
	of gold at its end, you don't know which one. So you'll 
	try all three. First go in tunnel 1, if that is not the 
	one, then come out of it, and go into tunnel 2, and 
	again if that is not the one, come out of it and go into 
	tunnel 3.So basically in backtracking we attempt solving a 
	subproblem, and if we don't reach the desired solution, then 
	undo whatever we did for solving that subproblem, 
	and try solving another subproblem.

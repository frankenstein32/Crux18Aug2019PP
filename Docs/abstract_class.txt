#DrawBack -> Multiple Inheritance not possible through Inheritance.




A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).





Abstract class in Java........

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.






#Ways to achieve Abstraction
There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java

1. Abstract class (0 to 100%)
2. Interface (100%)




Abstract class in Java
A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.


Points to Remember
It cannot be instantiated.
It can have constructors and static methods also.


 NOTE: If you are extending an abstract class that has an abstract method, you must either provide the implementation of the method or make this class abstract.

	Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object 
	acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent class object. 
	It is an important part of OOPs(Object Oriented Programming).

	The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes 
	that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing 
	class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, 
	you can add new methods and fields in your current class also
